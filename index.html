			Welcome to my website!
			<br>
			In it, I would like to use it as a portfolio to share my skills and projects I've been working into, please check the list below for details:
		</p>
		
		<ul class=content_list>
			<li><a href="pages/programs/GeoPicSorter">GeoPicSorter</a>: a free and open source tool for desktop systems that's written in Java, to help users organize pictures based on geolocation groups such as streets, cities, etc. JAR is available to try it right from the box.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/af-a1997/electro-urn-api" target=_blank>Electro Urn API</a>: a highly simple voting API written using Spring for educational purposes, the user sends HTTP requests to it to make the interactions. Instructions on how to set it up and use it are included.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/af-a1997/simple-hashing-tool" target=_blank>Simple Hashing Tool</a>: just a GUI based tool you can use to hash text into a few different algorithms using Google's Guava library.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/af-a1997/compraventa-vehicular" target=_blank>Compraventa Vehicular</a>: an example website using PHP, for educational purposes. <u>It's available only in Spanish</u>.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/af-a1997/simple_jobs_board" target=_blank>Simple Jobs Board</a>: a web board for educational purposes; companies can post jobs and manage candidates, and people can apply for jobs and manage the profile they share with the company. Roles don't work, so it's incomplete.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p class=page_pgh>I took the background picture, chosen purely to go with the dark theme I'm using on my website, you can view it in full <a href="rsrc/img/bg/IMG_20190912_190557.jpg" target=_blank>here</a>.</p>
