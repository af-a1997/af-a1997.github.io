			Welcome to my website! I'm Aldo, and this is my personal portfolio, you can read more about me in <a href="/pages/about_me">this section</a>, and/or check the following lists for some of my projects.

			<div class=section_content>
				<p>This is a list of programs I'm working on.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><a href="pages/programs/GeoPicSorter">GeoPicSorter</a>: a free and open source tool in its early development stages, designed for desktop systems and written in Java, using Apache NetBeans; it allows users to automatically organize pictures based on geolocation groups such as streets, cities, etc. Executable JAR file is available to try it right from the box.</li>
				</ul>

			<div class=section_heading>Published homework</div>
			<div class=section_content>
				<p>The following is some of the homework I've done during my studies I thought I'd share, in hopes it might help anyone with programming and website designing, these projects are shared <u>purely for educational purposes</u>, meaning they're ill-suited to be tools you can use on a daily basis:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/af-a1997/electro-urn-api" target=_blank>Electro Urn API</a>: a highly simple voting API written using the Spring Framework, the user sends HTTP requests to it to make the interactions. Instructions on how to set it up and use it are included.</li>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/af-a1997/simple-hashing-tool" target=_blank>Simple Hashing Tool</a>: just a really simple GUI based tool you can use to hash text into a few different algorithms using Google's Guava library.</li>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/af-a1997/compraventa-vehicular" target=_blank>Compraventa Vehicular</a>: an example vehicle shop website using PHP and a Bootstrap template. <u>Currently, it's available only in Spanish</u>.</li>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/af-a1997/simple_jobs_board" target=_blank>Simple Jobs Board</a>: a web board for educational purposes written using the Spring Framework, a template in Bootstrap and Thymeleaf; companies can post jobs and manage candidates, and people can apply for jobs and manage the profile they share with the company. <u>Roles don't work, so it's incomplete</u>.</li>
				</ul>

		<p class=page_pgh>I took the background picture, chosen purely to go with the dark theme I'm using on my website, you can view it in full <a href="rsrc/img/bg/IMG_20190912_190557.jpg" target=_blank>here</a>.</p>
